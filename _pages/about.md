I am a PhD student in Computer Science and founder of [aequa-tech](https://github.com/AequaTech/aequa-tech4ngi). I am studying implicit forms of discrimination, by exploring ethnic biases in existing public archives like Wikipedia and creating new resources for Natural Language Processing.

Before the PhD I worked for several years in ACMOS, an Italian non-profit for which I conceived and coordinated [Contro l'odio](https://controlodio.it/en/), a project aimed at monitoring Hate Speech online through NLP techniques, funded by Italian Government and [Google](https://blog.google/intl/it-it/notizie-aziendali/iniziative/ecco-i-vincitori-della-googleorg-impact/).

I am a teacher of Humanities enabled through two public examinations: the first allowed me to attend a national closed-number intership on teaching and pedagogy; with the second I obtained a permanent position (from which I am actually on leave)
