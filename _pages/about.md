Hi,

This is Marco Antonio Stranisci from Torino.

* I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Turin, where I study NLP and Semantic Web.

* I founded [aequa-tech](https://github.com/AequaTech/aequa-tech4ngi), a start-up of Artificial Intelligence, together with other 5 fellows of my University. 

* I conceived [Contro l'odio](https://controlodio.it/en/), a project aimed at monitoring Hate Speech online through NLP techniques, found the money to start it and managed it from 2018 to 2021.

* I taught Humanities at the middle school for 5 years (2015-2020) and I am actually on leave.

* I worked for [ACMOS](https://acmos.net/), a non-profit based on Turin, from 2005 to 2014.

* I travel a lot (within 10 km of my city and while reading).

> And south into the heart of light we walked, Memphis, you and me, close together and quiet, like the lost children walked somewhere, too, under the same sun maybe, though I kept feeling all the time that we were walking on the sun's surface and not under it, and I asked you, don't you feel like we're walking on the sun, but you didn't say anything in return, you weren't saying anything, nothing at all, which made me worry because it felt like you were disappearing and I was losing you all over again, even though you were right next to me, like a shadow
