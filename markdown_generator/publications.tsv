2016-05-01	Annotating Sentiment and Irony in the Online Italian Political Debate on #labuonascuola	Proceedings of the Tenth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'16)	In this paper we present the TWitterBuonaScuola corpus (TW-BS), a novel Italian linguistic resource for Sentiment Analysis, developed with the main aim of analyzing the online debate on the controversial Italian political reform “Buona Scuola” (Good school), aimed at reorganizing the national educational and training systems. We describe the methodologies applied in the collection and annotation of data	Marco Antonio Stranisci, Cristina Bosco, Delia Irazú Hernández Farías, and Viviana Patti. 2016.

2019-11-01	Annotating hate speech: Three schemes at comparison	Proceedings of the 6th Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLIC-it 2019)	Annotated data are essential to train and benchmark NLP systems. The reliability of the annotation, i.e. low interannotator disagreement, is a key factor, especially when dealing with highly subjective phenomena occurring in human language. Hate speech (HS), in particular, is intrinsically nuanced and hard to fit in any fixed scale, therefore crisp classification schemes for its annotation often show their limits. We test three annotation schemes on a corpus of HS, in order to produce more reliable data.	Fabio Poletto, Valerio Basile, Cristina Bosco, Viviana Patti, and Marco Antonio Stranisci. 2019.

2021-09-01	Representing the Under-Represented: a Dataset of Post-Colonial, and Migrant Writers	Proceedings of the 3rd Conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK 2021)	In today's media and in the Web of Data, non-Western people still suffer a lack of representation. In our work, we address this issue by presenting a pipeline for collecting and semantically encoding Wikipedia biographies of writers who are under-represented due to their non-Western origins, or their legal status in a country.

2022-06-01	APPReddit: a Corpus of Reddit Posts Annotated for Appraisal	Proceedings of the Thirteenth Language Resources and Evaluation Conference	Despite the large number of computational resources for emotion recognition, there is a lack of data sets relying on appraisal models. According to Appraisal theories, emotions are the outcome of a multi-dimensional evaluation of events. In this paper, we present APPReddit, the first corpus of non-experimental data annotated according to this theory.

2023-07-01	WikiBio: a Semantic Resource for the Intersectional Analysis of Biographical Events	Proceedings of the 61th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)	In this paper we fill this gap by presenting a new corpus annotated for biographical event detection. The corpus, which includes 20 Wikipedia biographies, was compared with five existing corpora to train a model for the biographical event detection task. The model was able to detect all mentions of the target-entity in a biography with an F-score of 0.808 and the entity-related events with an F-score of 0.859.  Finally, the model was used for performing an analysis of biases about women and non-Western people in Wikipedia biographies.
